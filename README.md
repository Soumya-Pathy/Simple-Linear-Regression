Regression analysis is one of the most widely used methods for prediction. Linear regression is probably the most fundamental machine learning method. A linear regression is a linear approximation of a causal relationship between two or more variables. OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) is the simplest, although often sufficient method to estimate the regression line.
